# Peaceful Target Practice
The name of our game is Peaceful Target Practice
## Narrative Structure
The game starts out at a target range, where you must throw energy balls at the targets to test your aim. Fortunately, it's just a peaceful target practice. Surely nothing bad will happen, right?
## Mechanics
Using the WASD Keys to move around the target range. Use the mouse to move the camera around and click to throw an energy ball!
## Aesthetics
We tried to theme our game like a futuristic weapons range, and our character and NPC Guide's character design are what mostly reflect that. The range is in a remote location. Our vision for the future also includes dragons.
## Joys and Struggles
We ran into a lot of trouble with animations all around. Our dragon also took a lot of effort to get to render properly. We did however enjoy getting to watch the game together.

## Contributions
Mason created our range and terrain layout and found and imported most of our assets. On top of this, Mason also created the target logic set up the dragon fight. Jory worked on the Title screen, added the skybox, and recorded voice lines that unfortunately did not make it into the final build of the game. Henry created the player and camera controllers, player animations, and throw mechanics.
